# 🚀 Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard - Power BI + SQL 🍕📊

#### Analyzing sales is crucial for any business! In this project, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover key insights into pizza sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends using SQL & DAX.

🎯 Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales performance and uncover key business insights such as revenue trends, customer preferences, and best-selling items. The dashboard provides a dynamic, data-driven solution for decision-making in a retail food business.

🛠 Tech Stack Used:
 ✔️ SQL – Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation
 ✔️ Power BI – Dashboard development & data visualization
 ✔️ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures for deeper insights

🔍 My Process:
➡️ Initial Data Understanding – Explored dataset in Excel to review fields, values & data types.
➡️ Data Preparation in SQL – Loaded the dataset into SQL Server, performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and identified:
 🔹 Top & Bottom 5 Pizzas
 🔹 Best & Worst Selling Items
 🔹 Key KPIs for business performance
➡️ Dashboard Creation in Power BI – Designed an interactive & visually appealing report.

📊 Key Insights:
📌 Peak Sales Periods: Weekends (Friday & Saturday) & months (July & January).
 📌 Revenue & Orders Analysis: $817.86K total revenue & 21,350 total orders.
 📌 Top-Selling Pizzas:
Highest Revenue: Thai Chicken Pizza
Most Sold: Classic Deluxe Pizza
 📌 Least-Selling Pizza: Brie Carre had the lowest sales.
 📌 Category Performance: Classic & Large-sized pizzas drive the highest revenue.
